# **STYLE GUIDE for Donation Tracker Form**

This guide explains the design principles and structure of the layout. 
It provides clarity on the visual choices made to have accessibility, clarity, 
and consistency across the layout and form elements.

---

## **1. Global Styles**

- **Box Model Reset:** All elements have `box-sizing: border-box;` applied, ensuring consistent padding and margin 
behavior across browsers.

- **Font Choice:** The page uses a clean, modern sans-serif font (Segoe UI), which is easy to read and widely 
supported on most devices.

- **Text and Background Colors:** A soft, light gray background (`whitesmoke`) with gray text helps reduce visual strain, creating a calm environment. Headers and footers use dark blue to convey a professional look.

---

## **2. Layout Styles**

- **Header & Footer:** The header and footer have a dark blue background, with white text centered for better visibility and clarity.

- **Navigation Bar:** Positioned below the header, the navigation bar uses a lighter blue to differentiate it, with 
centered links for easy navigation.

- **Main Content Area:** The main content is centered, ensuring readability on both small and large screens. 
A white background, rounded corners, and subtle box shadow add to the clean, modern aesthetic.

## **3. Form Styling**

- **Form Labels:** Labels are bold and black, ensuring they are clearly distinguished from the form fields. They are displayed as block elements for proper alignment.

- **Form Inputs & Textarea:** Inputs and textareas are full-width with padding for easy interaction. They have a light gray border, and their background turns blue when focused, offering clear feedback to the user.

---

## **4. Error Handling**

- **Error Messages:** Error messages are displayed in red with a smaller font size to avoid overwhelming the form. They appear below the respective input fields to clearly indicate what needs to be corrected.

## **Conclusion**

This design is simple, professional, and focused on usability, making it suitable for a donation-focused website. 
These styles can be adapted to other pages or forms as needed while maintaining the core principles of clarity and 
accessibility.
